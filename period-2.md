# Period-2  
###Basic JavaScript, node.js and es2015   

*In this period we will introduce Express, a minimal and flexible node.js package, that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. We will also introduce the Mocha test framework together with a number of supplementing packages for assertions, mocking etc.*

# **20-02-Monday** 
* Using Express
* Express Middleware
* Server Side Rendering with Express


#### Before this lesson you should:

Before this lesson you should:
Watch watch this video (but see notes below first): [Server Side Apps with Node/Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QseHOX-5nJQ)
**Note:** things change extremely fast in the Node-world, so do the following to get a start project (instead of the instructions in the video)
* Create a new folder called express1
* Open a terminal and type:  npm init
* Enter an name (express1) when requested and app.js as entry point and use defaults for the rest
* Observe that this has created a file package.json in you folder.
* Now type npm install express --save
* Observe how this created a folder node_modules and added "something" to your package.json file
 
Now just follow the tutorial :-)

### Read/Watch
If you like videos, since it gives you a chance to code along in your own speed, Lynda.com have a complete Node/Express course with some cool testing videos. 
Once logged in to Lynda search for "Node.js Essential Training" and watch:
* Testing with mocha and Chai
*	Asynchronous mocha testing
*	Mocking a server with NOCK
*	Code Coverage with Istanbul

As usual, the API descriptions should be your main resource for Mocha/Chai-questions.
*	[Mocha] (http://mochajs.org/ )
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/#method_throw)
