## Getting Started React


### Before this lesson you should:
For this period I suggest that you **for all projects** use the *create-react-app* to create the setup for your apps
Install and test it as explained [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Go through this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/) uptil the ReactJS - Router section.

### Note: I will assume you have started with this tutorial in this lesson

**Important:** SKIP the section "ReactJS - Environment Setup" and do the following instead;
Clone and use this project [https://github.com/Lars-m/tutorialPointsReact.git](https://github.com/Lars-m/tutorialPointsReact.git) as a start template
When cloned, do the following (familar) steps and follow the instructions on the start page:
- ```npm install```
- Open in your favourite Editor (```code.``` if you are using vs-code) 
- ```npm start```, to run the project via WebPack
