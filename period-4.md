#### Before this lesson you should:
This period will have focus on mobile Hybrid Development with Ionic 1.x and Angular 1.x.

Make sure that all the guidelines and documentation you read/find is for Ionic 1.x. 
Ionic uses Angular and Ionic 1.x is for Angular 1.x (the version we have used) and Ionic 2.x if for Angular 2.x.

Read chapter 1-4 in [Guide](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/)
As a minimum you should have set up your laptop for Android development as explained in [chapter2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/installation.html)  
Bring an Android phone + a USB cable for this lesson. If not, we won't reach our goal which is to create a working app, with a corresponding REST backend in one day ;-)
