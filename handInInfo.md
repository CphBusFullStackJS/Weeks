To provide you with the practical background for these goals, and to have practical examples for the exam, each day have included a number of exercises. Your solution to these exercises is what have to be handed in.


## How do I hand in?
Assemble all your code in one folder/project and commit the code to github. You must include a README.md file with a short description for how your code maps to the leaning goals (a perfect up-front preparation for the exam).
Find a person with whom you want to do a peer review (you review the code from this person, and your code is reviewed by the same person)

You provide study points as for the feedback you received from the reviw (max 6) 

Add your **name** + **git-hub** link to this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ryWRwJExuJlyuRfYdyRfRwOITqZItRneWDiY0RM81M/edit?usp=sharing) , and **both parts** should fill in the required information:
