### Before this lesson you should:
To "tune" everyone into this new topic, we will make a **hacker competition**, focused around sessions hijacking and cross-site scripting. I will set up a siiiimpel session-driven server that are allowed to attack and:

- First hacker who discover a session ID will receive 2 "plain beers" ;-)
- First hacker who discover "protected" data from another user,  receives a GOOD beer
