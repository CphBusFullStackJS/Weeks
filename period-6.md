## Security -1


### Before this lesson you should:
To "tune" everyone into this new topic, we will make a **hacker competition**, focused around sessions hijacking and cross-site scripting. I will set up a siiiimpel session-driven server that you are allowed to attack and:

- First hacker who discover a session ID will receive 2 "plain beers" ;-)
- First hacker who discover "protected" data from another user,  receives a GOOD beer ;-)

Before Monday, you should read the following:

- XSS: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)
- Session Hijacking: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack
- A bit about it all and jwt's: https://stormpath.com/blog/build-secure-user-interfaces-using-jwts

A couple of quick videos that can be enjoyed on the couch

## Security-2
#### Before this lesson you should:
Watch this short GENIOUS video about password hashing, salting etc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6cmuiTBZVs  

Watch one of the videos below, related to Json Web Tokens, which is the technology you are supposed to use for the last hand-in:
- [Introduction to JWT (JSON Web Token) - Securing apps & services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXxbB5kv9OA)
- [100% Stateless with JWT (JSON Web Token)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67mezK3NzpU&t=3028s) (Longer than the video above, but gives a fantastic overview of the pros and cons with using JWT's. My introduction in the class will draw on this presentation)
