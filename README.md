# Weeks


## P1  Basic JavaScript, node.js and es2015   

*In this period we will refresh our JavaScript knowledge from previous semester and introduce the node.js platform. Finally we will introduce the newest versions of JavaScript and focus on what it takes to use it, both on the server and on clients. Learning Goals*


### 30-01 (Monday)
* Vanilla JavaScript with Node.js
* An introduction to Node.JS
* Scope, Hoisting, Closures, this, Prototyping, etc.
* Basic asynchronous programming with JavaScript

### Before this lesson you should:
* [Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)  (I suggest the LTS version)
* [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Visual Studio Code(vs-code)
* [Read](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript) this document about vs-code, and install (my recommendations) the following extensions before the lesson: 
 *Debugger for Chrome, EsLint, Babel ES6/ES7, Path IntelliSense, npm Intellisense, vscode-icons*
* If you like videos, watch a few of [these](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/overview) (you might wanna come back later):

**Please note:Without Node + a sufficient Editor/IDE, there is really no reason to attend this lesson ;-)**
